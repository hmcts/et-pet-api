# We all hate patches - I know !!
#
# But, at the moment, active storage will not generate valid SAS signatures when connected to azurite simulator.
# The bug occurs as the path contains the account name which is valid when using the simulator (as you cannot
# use subdomains like normal azure blob storage) - however, the signature generator adds the account name
# to the body of the text that it generates the signature for.
#
# So, to prevent you going mad when you upgrade for a different reason, this patch will deliberately fail, forcing you to come back to this file
# and read this comment - then deciding if the patch is still needed.  If it is, simply update the version checker in the code below
#
