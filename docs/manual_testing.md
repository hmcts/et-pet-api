# Manual Testing

Manual testing is always going to be a little difficult when we are dealing with a
system that interfaces to another.

But, there are some tools and tricks to help

## The Admin

The admin url is

http://localhost:(your admin port)/admin

If you are using the standard test setup using docker, or without docker and have ran the
db:seed rake task, you will be able to login with these users - all with password 'password'

* admin@example.com
* senioruser@example.com
* junioruser@example.com

These 3 users are primarily for demonstrating the roles functionality and
how users can be restricted.
